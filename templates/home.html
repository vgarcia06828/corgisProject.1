<h2> Video Game Data</h2>
<br> 

<p> This webapp was created in order to inform the reader about video games and their popularity in the early twenty-first century. All the data that was used in this website is linked at the bottom. All the video games listed in this website were published within the years 2004-2008. A couple of examples of the data that this website contains is the year it was published, the publisher, whether the video game is a sequel to another game, what the normal price of the game was, the revenue the game brought in, the slow, average, and fastest times recorded for completing the game, and the number of players who reported completing the game. </p>
